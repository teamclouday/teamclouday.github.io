        <br />I like coding very much!!

                    <h>C#</h><br /><br />C# is the first language I've learned.<br />I learned it by myself, with help of information online and a book: 
                    <a href="http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/Beginning-C-6-Programming-with-Visual-Studio-2015.productCd-1119096685.html">
                    "Beginning C# 6 Programming with Visual Studio 2015"</a>.
                    <br />Though some people think it is not a good choice for the first language to learn. The truth is I benefit a lot from the code.
                    <br />For me, it is a language of functions and objects. For most aspects, it cares the user more than itself.
                    <br />Also, I watched a lot of tutorials on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=C%23">Youtube</a>. 
                    <br />Besides the basic console applications. I learnt wpf, winform and websites. They are all very interesting.
                    <br />By the way... All these are done with <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio</a>. Thus, I love it <strong>very much!!</strong>

                <td id="ExpWords">
                    <h>Haskell</h><br />
                    <br /><a href="https://www.haskell.org/hoogle/">Haskell</a> is basically the first language I've learnt officially.(i.e.In college)
                    <br />I like this language very much, since it is functional and very capable of handling data.
                    <br />Also, it has a lot of built-in functions, which makes coding easier.
                    <br />However, it is mostly compiled in a unix-based system, which is very inconvenient for me(a Windows user) to play with.
                    <br />On one hand, it is powerful when dealing with massive data. On the other hand, it lacks the friendlyness when interacting with <strong>human</strong> users.
                    <br />Currently, I'm still studying it as a course of my major. I do hope I could get command of most of it, before this course ends.

                    <h>Html</h><br />
                    <br />I learnt this language from <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/">SoloLearn</a>.
                    <br />Thanks to its rich tutorial and friendly community, I've lit my passion for this language.
                    <br />For me, it is the door to creating a real website(Not using somthing like wix...).
                    <br />Right now, I'm not that experienced with its coding, which is why I start to write this Personal Profile website.
                    <br />During the course of learning, I also encountered 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a> and 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">Javascript</a>. They're all very helpful in building wesites. 
                    Based on my experience with C#, I'm able to get familiar with them within a short time.

                    <h>Java</h><br />
                    <br />For me, this is a very powerful language, which I also learnt from <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/">SoloLearn</a>.
                    <br />However, I surprisingly haven't play with it very often!! 
                    <br />Unlike C#, this language can code applications for literally all platforms. I hope one day, I can write an app for my phone with it.
                    <br />There's several years before my graduation. I believe there'll be time.

                    <h>Python</h><br />
                    <br />I personally like this language very much. It is as powerful as Haskell when handling data, and as friendly as most 
                    user-faced languages. Moreover, I could write code on my phone with apps like 
                    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroid3">Pydroid3</a>.
                    <br />Besides this, it is very easy to read and write, since its principle is the easier the better.
                    <br />Like Haskell, it also has some built-in functions that makes coding easier, as well as a lot of external libraries.
                    <br />Python is also well-known for its use in AI. Therefore, I will try to learn more about it!
